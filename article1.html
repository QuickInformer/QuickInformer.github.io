            <h2>Who's behind it?</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout history, <b>forces</b> from different areas have tried to
                <b>gain control</b> over other groups. They have seen this as something
                essential in order to obtain their desired outcome.

            <h2>How are they doing it?</h2>
            <p>
                There are different <b>methods</b> being used by those <b>in power</b> to maintain
                people under their <b>dominion.</b> We may not even be aware of the things
                that are being done on us. Inserting <b>fear</b> in people's <b>mind</b> is one of 
                their top tools they have in their arsenal.

            <h2>Our Response</h2>
            <p>
                After knowing <b>the truth,</b> why would anyone decide to live in a lie?
                No one should be afraid of those who try to keep us under their control,
                controlling our minds and actions. Actually, they are the ones <b>afraid of us</b>
                because they know that each individual represents a <b>threat to their existence.</b>
