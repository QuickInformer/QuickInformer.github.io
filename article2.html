            <h2>Early Years of Life</h2>
            <p>
                We were <b>born</b> into this <b>system.</b> From the time you stepped into this world,
                there was a set way that your life would head to. You were put into a <b>conditioning
                factory,</b> where your mind would <b>be programmed</b> and given the type of <b>functions</b> 
                they wanted it to possess. A very known place where this occurs is at <b>regular school.</b>
                If you pay close attention at the <b>"educational system"</b> you will notice that most
                things taught there is basically <b>useless.</b>

            <h2>Grip on your Mind</h2>
            <p>
                Your <b>mind is valuable.</b> It's what tells you what you want. If you don't have control over your mind
                it's because something external has control or <b>influence</b> over your thoughts and mental state.

            <h2>School Life</h2>
            <p>
            It's all a matter of time before you find yourself <b>following the crowd's way</b> of doing things.
            This affects us all, that's how they been doing it. Be born, learn to walk, <b>go to school from kindergarden
            through highschool,</b> spend around 7 hours of your 24 hours at school, plus 1 hour doing homework.
            Land a job while in highschool, <b>responsibilities stacking up,</b> graduate highschool.
            After done with highschool, you're technically <b>on your own.</b> Follow your aspirations,
            get a full time job, move out your parents/guardian house. Go to college, graduate college.

            <h2>School as Conditioning Factory</h2>
            <p>
                Modern <b>school education</b> often emphasizes <b>conformity and compliance</b> rather than individuality 
                and critical thinking. <b>Issues</b> include standardization and a focus on preparing students for existing roles,
                which can <b>limit creativity.</b> Treating students as if they exist only to fit into a mold instead of unique thinkers.
                <br><br>
                This approach not only <b>undermines students' passions</b> but also prepares them to fit into a system rather than <b>challenging it.</b>
                We need a <b>change</b> in education that <b>empowers students</b> to explore, innovate, and engage meaningfully with the world,
                nurturing their <b>potentials</b> as independent thinkers and leaders.

            <h2>After School</h2>
            <p>
            Move to an apartment <b>alone,</b> with a friend, or go back to your parents/guardian house.
            Accumulate bills, <b>stress over responsibilities.</b> Continue on planning future life, <b>wasted.</b>
            Find yourself stucked in the same lifestyle and working at an average paying job, still doing poorly.
            <b>Work, work, and work.</b> After your 60s, you <b>retire</b> and try to enjoy the <b>painful rest</b> of your life at an retirement center,
            thinking about your overall life decisions and experiences.
            <b>The end.</b>
