            <h2>The Human Condition</h2>
            <p>
                In the beginning, <b>humanity was separated from God because of sin.</b>
                People tried to make things right through <b>animal sacrifices,</b>
                but these sacrifices could only <b>temporarily</b> cover sin and <b>couldn't
                fully restore</b> the broken relationship between humans and God.

            <h2>God's Plan of Redemption</h2>
            <p>
                However, <b>God had a plan</b> to provide a <b>permanent solution.</b>
                Out of His <b>great love</b> for humanity, He sent <b>His Son, Jesus Christ,</b> to Earth.
                Jesus, who is both <b>fully divine</b> as the Son of God and <b>fully human,</b>
                lived a <b>perfect and sinless</b> life among us. He showed us God's love,
                taught us about God's kingdom, and demonstrated <b>His power</b> through miracles.

            <h2>The Sacrificial Death of Jesus</h2>
            <p>
                But the most amazing part of <b>Jesus' mission was His sacrificial death on the cross.</b>
                Jesus willingly gave His life as the <b>perfect sacrifice for the sins of humanity.</b>
                His death fulfilled the purpose of all the animal sacrifices once and for all.
                Through His sacrifice, Jesus offered forgiveness and <b>reconciliation with God</b> to all who believe in Him.

            <h2>The Resurrection and Victory</h2>
            <p>
                Three days after His death, <b>Jesus rose from the dead,</b>
                demonstrating His <b>victory over sin and death.</b>
                This resurrection confirmed His identity as the <b>Son of God</b> and the <b>power of His sacrifice.</b>
                Because of Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection,
                people can now have their <b>sins completely forgiven</b> and their relationship with God fully restored.

            <h2>Faith and Salvation</h2>
            <p>
                Now, <b>anyone who believes in Jesus and accepts Him as their only Lord and Savior</b> can experience the good news of the Gospel.
                They can have a personal relationship with God, <b>receive forgiveness for their sins,</b>
                and have the <b>hope of eternal life.</b>
                Jesus' sacrifice was enough to cover all sins, past, present, and future,
                making animal sacrifices obsolete.

            <h2>The Gospel's Promise and Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                In summary, <b>the good news of the Gospel is that through Jesus Christ,
                God offers forgiveness, reconciliation, and eternal life to all who believe in His Son.</b>
                Jesus is the Son of God, the perfect sacrifice for sin, and the <b>only way to salvation.</b>
                His death and resurrection provide the way for humanity to be saved and restored to a right relationship with God.
                The <b>Word of God Almighty,</b> also known as the "Bible", states, 
                <span class="highlight">"Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:
                no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me."</span>
